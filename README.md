- Choice of transcription engines (Gemini, Google STT)
- Real-time display of transcription results with confidence scores
- Export transcription results in multiple formats
- Audio preprocessing and WAV conversion capabilities

### 2. CER/SER Analysis
- Character Error Rate (CER) and Sentence Error Rate (SER) calculation
- Support for multiple input formats (JSON, CSV, TXT)
- Detailed error analysis (substitutions, deletions, insertions)
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Visual presentation of analysis results
- Export capabilities for analysis results

## Prerequisites

### Environment Variables
